Hi 👋
I moved from corporate employee to freelancer, working as UI-, UX- & Web-Designer and Developer and Tech Support. I'm a hobbyist Tech- & Design-Blogger, and piano novice. I care about building a circular economy ♻️, sustainable renewable energy 🔋🌞, and the carbon footprint of inefficient software like LLMs 💻💨.

I’ve moved most of my projects into private archives to hybernate here while the live repositories are elsewhere—you won’t see much activity here. Why? My goal is to use as few US services as possible at the moment because of the general lawlessness currently spreading through the US government under Trump.

I’m working on a new blog, until then, [here is the old one.](https://wenzels.blog/)

Find me on Mastodon [@stairjoke@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@stairjoke) and BlueSky [@staijroke.ninja](https://bsky.app/profile/stairjoke.ninja)
