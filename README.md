Hi 👋 I moved from corporate employee to freelancer, working as UI-, UX- & Web-Designer and Developer and Tech Support. I'm a hobbyist Tech- & Design-Blogger, and piano novice.

My passions mean I care about building a circular economy ♻️, sustainable renewable energy 🔋🌞, and the carbon footprint of inefficient software 💻💨.
