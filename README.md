Hi 👋
I moved from corporate employee to freelancer, working as UI-, UX- & Web-Designer, Developer, and Tech Support. I'm a hobbyist Tech- & Design-Blogger, and piano novice. I care about building a circular economy ♻️, sustainable renewable energy 🔋🌞, and the carbon footprint of inefficient software like LLMs 💻💨.

I’ve moved my projects off GitHub as a resopnse to the Trump Administration’s lawlessness, inhumanity, aggression against allies, and general lack of trustworthyness. I have moved to use as few US services as possible to reduce risk of unlawful abuse of my data. Moving was quite a lot of work and you will not see me moving back to US services for the foreseeable future.

**I’m active on:**
- My Blog: [Stairjoke.ninja](https://stairjoke.ninja)
- Mastodon [@stairjoke@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@stairjoke)

I have accounts elsewhere, but I mostly don’t use them.
